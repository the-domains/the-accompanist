A few years ago I had the pleasure of being asked to play for contemporary violinist Doug Cameron. He was giving a concert a Kansas State University with the university's orchestra, and I was approached to be the keyboardist for his rhythm section. This collaboration was so rewarding and exciting. One particular piece of Doug's, _Passion Suite_, featured yours truly. I hope you enjoy it.
