description: "My name is Nate, and I am a 25 year old collaborative pianist and theatrical accompanist. I specialize in music theatre accompaniment, both of performances and rehearsals. I'm classically trained, and have experience with a broad range of styles, from classical and romantic, to musical theatre, jazz, and beyond. I'd love to accompany your next theatrical production, join your band for a gig, or play at your wedding, cocktail party or reception.\_"

My name is Nate, and I am a 25 year old collaborative pianist and theatrical accompanist. I specialize in music theatre accompaniment, both of performances and rehearsals. I'm classically trained, and have experience with a broad range of styles, from classical and romantic, to musical theatre, jazz, and beyond. I'd love to accompany your next theatrical production, join your band for a gig, or play at your wedding, cocktail party or reception.
